## Sexual Prevention Mobile Apps
Sexual harassment cases in Indonesia is one of the most critical issue in Indonesia. It increases by the time. At the sametime the victims still have no courage to report their problem. Nowadays the authorities lack responses to the victims report. It becomes a trust issue since the victims have no power and courage to fight for their rights. Our team develop an application to prevent the sexual harassment by notify other people with an alarm in loud. It also helps users make a report easier. Hopefully this application will decrease the number of sexual harasment cases.
