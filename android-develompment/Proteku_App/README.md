## Mobile Development Documentation

## Overview
- We designed the UI for the application and added the function to each button and section.
- It successfully works on each button. The main button, SOS button, can work properly. A loud sound of “tolong” as an output if we hold the button for 3 seconds.
- Deployment database report history form and classification of types of sexual harassment using API Firebase still on progress.
- We used Figma for design and Android Studio for the rest. 
- We also use Kotlin as our programming language.
